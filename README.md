# GoFigure
Note: this is work in progress.
A program to compare the similarity of two texts in a very simple manner using Go. This is still work in progress.

The end result will be a CLI program that calculates a value/array of values of a text such that a text will always get the same value assigned to it.

I also want to build a model such that I can figure out if a text falls outside of expectations given a new input.

However, I might decide to build that in another langauage if that is more convinient.
